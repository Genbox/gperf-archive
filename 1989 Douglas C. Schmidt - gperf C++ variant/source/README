While teaching a data structures course at University of California,
Irvine, I developed a program that generates perfect hash functions
for sets of reserved words.  A perfect hash function is simply:

      A hash function and and a data structure that allows
      recognition of a key word in a set using 1 probe into the data
      structure.  

The gperf.texinfo file explains how the program works, the form of the
input, what options to choose, and what limitations you may encounter.
The Makefile creates the executable program ``gperf'' and also runs
some tests.

NOTE THAT YOU MUST HAVE G++ 1.35 OR LATER TO ASSURE THE PROPER
FUNCTIONING FOR THE GPERF PROGRAM.
